		<strong>Biography by Angela Bizera<br /></strong>
		<strong>Photo by Luanda Bauma Primo<br /></strong><br />

	  
		Mutombo Esdras is a young man from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He arrived in Dzaleka in 2013, and is a student at Daeyang University. He spends most of his leisure time outside of classes writing and performing at various local events in the camp.<br /><br />
		
    	He started learning poetry through a children’s art club that was in the camp, where he did both writing and acting. He then started doing poetry more seriously when he got into high school and performed at the weekly school assembly on Mondays. This helped to develop his skills. Making art for him means that he can always be improving and making a positive impact, sending a message of love, hope, and peace to people around the world.<br /><br />
		
		The pieces that he shares are close to his heart, and he would like people to read and enjoy them because poetry is like a ray of sunshine; it feels good when it hits the spot. <br /><br />

    	Lost In Love (Poem 1)<br /><br />
	  
    	A forest full of laughter and joy,<br />
	  
      	An emotional playground for girls and boys,<br />
	  
  	 	Where bleeding hearts come to rest,<br />
	  
		Where majestic angels lay their nest<br /><br />
	  
	 	I come in search of a home<br />
	
		Where my heart will feel safe <br />

		Like the fresh air in Rome<br />
	
		I look for a girl so pretty <br />

		Whose smile is the source of my poetry<br /><br />

		Love is what I seek<br />

		Because hate just makes me sick<br />
	
		I will hold on to her so quick, <br />
	
		Because with her I am Lost In love<br /><br /><br />

		Oh boy, oh boy! (Poem 2)<br /><br />

		Waking up to the sound of guns<br />

		Bullets piecing through the walls<br />
	
		Screams of mothers<br />
	
		Children, animals, and fathers <br />

		Bonds broken <br />

		Peace stolen, my fear to the terror awakened <br />

		Oh boy! Oh boy!<br /><br />
	
		Tears roll down our faces <br />
	
		Can’t find my sister, Oh Boy! Oh Boy! <br />

		Flooded with blood <br />

		I stare at the Copses of two, frozen<br />
	
		Features, are they dead? Oh boy! Oh boy!<br /><br />

		Houses destroyed, no rescue <br />

		We are just like a bee hive, destroyed <br />
	
		Now, everyone scattered, running <br />

		For their lives. The old perish <br />

		The place is covered by a fog of hatred and pain <br />
		
		Oh boy! Oh boy!<br /><br />

		Wishing to just dial 911 <br />

		But we don’t have it here, it’s just us<br />
	
		And the bullets, one by one <br />

		We cover our heads and close our eyes as the war rages on<br />

		Oh boy! Oh boy!<br />
