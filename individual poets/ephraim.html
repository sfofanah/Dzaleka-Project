		<strong>Biography by Angela Bizera<br /></strong>
		<strong>Photo by Luanda Bauma Primo<br /></strong><br />

	  
		Ephraim Mpona is a young man living in the Dzaleka refugee camp. He was born in 2007 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He arrived in Malawi in the year of 2016, and currently is a student.<br /><br />
		
    	He likes poetry because he can say everything he wants. He can express anything, all his feelings, and there is no discrimination. There is just peace. He started doing poetry through a friend from school. The performances together encouraged him and he started writing on his own as a result. To him, poetry means the world.<br /><br />
		
		One of his poems, “Stairs to Your Heart” talks and reflects on how we try to get ourselves into a relationship. In his poem, he writes about someone who is trying to be in a relationship with a girl, and the stages he goes through to be able to reach that girl. The poem, “My Emotions and Feelings,” has a similar theme.  A guy tells and expresses his feelings directly to a girl.<br /><br />
		
		His words to the readers of this book and website are that poetry is in Ephraim’s nature.<br /><br />
