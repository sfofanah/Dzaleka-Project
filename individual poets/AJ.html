    	AJ Peace Justice is a young man from Rwanda who is 18 years old. He arrived in Malawi in 2015 and is currently a student.<br /><br />
		
    	For him, poems are emotions that you can express in written words, and it relieves you. He started his poetry after he got inspired by a friend, Espoir, who started teaching him while they were in standard 8. He firstly recited and performed poetry during a school assembly. The way people perceived his work and encouraged him after the performance pushed him to continue with his writing. He loves poetry a lot, because he can express himself easily.<br /><br />
		
		He wrote a poem about discrimination because he saw and felt the need to speak against discrimination towards people living with disabilities. To him, it is important that such issues are spoken about and addressed. <br /><br />
		
		He tells readers of the book and viewers of the website that, through his poems, he hopes they can learn.<br /><br />
