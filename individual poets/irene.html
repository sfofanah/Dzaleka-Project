	  <strong>Irene M. Mubeho</strong><br />
	  <strong>Republic of Rwanda</strong><br />
	  <strong>Biography collected and written by Angela Azibera</strong><br />

    	Irene M. Mubeho is a female Rwandese by nationality and is currently living in the Dzaleka refugee camp in Malawi. Her family came to Malawi in the year of 2002.  She was born  on January 5, 2003 and was raised in the camp. Currently she is a university student, studying at one of the universities here in Malawi. <br /><br />
		
    	Irene started writing poems in 2016 when she was in secondary school. She loves poetry because every time she would hear poems since she was young, it would touch her heart. Growing up, every time she would hear her age mates recite poems, she wanted to be like them. There came a time where she was motivated and thought of giving it a try. Her English teacher complimented and encouraged her to continue writing.<br /><br />
		
		About the poems she shared, to begin with “Who Shall I Blame”, Irene wrote because she realized that students tend to blame teachers, friends, and other things for their own laziness and irresponsibility. As a result she thought of writing this poem to let her fellow students understand that they are responsible for the outcomes of the choices they make in their lives: be it not doing well in school, being withdrawn from school, and many other choices. They hold themselves to blame. For the second one “It Flew and Never Returned”, her main focus in this poem was time. People in general tend to forget that time flies and can never be retrieved once it’s gone. This explains some of the consequences that come as a result of misusing time. She wants people not to waste their time and come to regret it later when it’s too late.<br /><br />
		
		To all the readers, especially young people who are still in school, she encourages them to pay for their lives properly in terms of their studies and time management. They should learn to accept mistakes and shortfalls, learn from them and strive to improve. To everyone in general, life is too short to waste time and live a life of regret. There is so much to do that can improve our living rather than wasting time on regrets.<br /><br />
