			<p class="text-uppercase mt-md-3 text-left" style="font-size: 180%;"><strong>Biography</strong></p>
			  
			  	My name is Angela Abizera, originally from Rwanda. I hardly know my story, I was young then. I currently reside in the Dzaleka refugee camp in Malawi. I am passionate about helping other people and working for the community. I am student doing an online degree, and I do voluntary work under Plan International Malawi as a mentor for the Dzaleka Children Parliament. I am also engaged in a youth group.<br /><br />
		
				I love writing. I just started writing and got inspired and encouraged by friends. Two of my friends who were in the Branches Arts Group here in the camp approached me and told me that they  heard that I write poems. They kept on requesting that I show them my poems even though I denied that I write. Then I finally gave in and showed them one of the poems I had written and sent to my friends titled “Dear Peace.” They loved it and invited me to join their group, and I did. I never learned about poetry. I would say it’s a natural thing because I remember back in the days, I would write short fiction stories and dramas,  but at the moment I am not doing that anymore.<br /><br />

				Poetry is a powerful tool to be used as you can convey different messages. When people read my poems, I want them to grasp something either to entertain them or educate them. I want my poems to always have a message.<br /><br />

				My poem that is titled “Dear Peace” is a poem I wrote as I thought about the refugee crisis. I was questioning myself why wars happen and yet peace is something that we all need and can be used to solve many problems. My other poem, “Love Found Us Young,”  is romantic and talks about love.I want to always inspire people out there that love is a beautiful thing despite the many challenges that occur in a relationship.<br /><br />

				Arts is a very beautiful thing. It can be used to implement a lot of projects and help sensitize a lot of occurring issues in the word. Use arts to paint the world.<br /><br /><br />
