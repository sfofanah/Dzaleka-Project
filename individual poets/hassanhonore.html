	  	<strong>24 years old</strong><br />
		<strong>Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br />
		<strong>Biography by Angela Bizera</strong><br />
		<strong>Photo by Luanda Bauma Primo</strong><br /><br />
	  
	  
	  
		Hassan Chilewu is a young man from the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was born on 06 May, 1999 in Malawi. His family came to Malawi in 1996 due to insecurities in their home country. He does volunteer work through Plan International Malawi as a mentor of the Dzaleka Children Parliament and is engaged in a youth group.<br /><br />
		
    	He is a poet that writes and recites. He did not learn his poetry. Instead, he was inspired by his brother’s writing. He picked them and compared them to his own that he was developing. Of course, his were not great then but he kept pushing till today and he does not know if he is better yet. He began writing in the year 2013, and in 2014 he performed for the first time at a poetry competition which did not work out well for him.<br /><br />
		
		Writing poetry for him means speaking through writing what he cannot speak. He expresses himself better in poetry, and poetry is love, kindness, goodness. Poetry is an instrument weapon used for change.<br /><br />
		
		People out there read and listen to what they want to but in the actual sense they should be reading and listening to every writing. They should come and check out the outside world and listen to the words that are being bled by young men and women.<br /><br />
