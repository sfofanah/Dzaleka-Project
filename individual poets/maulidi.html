    	Maulidi is a young man from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)  aged 14 years. He came to Malawi in 2016 when his family fled DRC due to security concerns. He is a student and is in secondary school at the moment. <br /><br />
		
    	He started poetry while he was in primary school. He was inspired by his friends, who could write and recite poems. This made him interested.  He consulted his friends who helped him, and he started writing his own poems as well. They later started doing group poems and formed their own group called “The Clever Boys.”<br /><br />
