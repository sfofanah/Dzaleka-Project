	  <strong>Biography by Angela Bizera </strong><br />

    	Ramazani Amissi, “ISJO” (a nickname combination of his mother’s and father’s names) was born in 2005 in Baraka. He came to Malawi in 2014 after his family fled due to threats in their home country. Currently, he is a Form Two student.<br /><br />
		
    	He writes poems to express the stories of his life and everything he goes through. He started poetry at the White Future Center where he was learning English. His teacher organized a competition for them to recite their poems. ISJO took part, and his teacher was impressed by him, as were his fellow students. This recognition and encouragement made him happy and inspired him to continue doing poetry. He started reading and doing research on poetry, and his teacher pushed him towards many different activities. This later led to the birth of A.P., which stands for Amissi Poetry. <br /><br />
		
		In one of his poems, “Fighting For Equality,” he emphasizes the many problems and difficulties which are faced while promoting gender equality. The poem focuses on how great thinkers from the past tried their best to promote such equality. He is encouraging everyone to join the fight, support, and promote the campaign.<br /><br />
		
		His words and advice to the readers of the book and website is that they should keep on trying, step by step, until they reach their achievements.<br /><br />

    	EQUALITY<br /><br />
	  
    	It has been time and time <br />
	  
      	With no solution discovered<br />
	  
  	 	That all our imagination are crowded <br />
	  
		No longer how should I rhyme  <br /><br />
	  
	 	It has been time and time<br />
	
		Recalling me the past days <br />

		That madam Mary says <br />

		Men and women are born with same capabilities <br />

		With the motive of gender equality<br /><br />

		I can remember <br />

		You can remember <br />

		That we’ve been born in the period of seeing<br />

		And in the age of reasoning <br />

		With the war of promoting gender equality <br /><br />

		Were quote from words<br />

		Keep on trying  <br />
	
		Each failure is one step closer to a success<br />

		Were still in the world of success<br />
	
		Until we stand upright like flag <br /><br />

		we still recall the 17th and 18th centuries<br />
	
		that the thinkers criticized on the churches<br />
	
		with the believer in reason rather than in churches<br />

		as their rebirth of freedom of speech <br />
	
		that appealed the basis of human rights <br /><br />

		let’s all stand together    <br />
	
		to fulfill our dreams  <br />

		and fly with no wings   <br />

		as all together  <br />

		whoever  <br />

		wherever <br />

		whenever  <br />
