	  	<strong>Clement Mboye</strong><br />
	  	<strong>18 years old</strong><br />
		<strong>Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br />
		<strong>Biography by Angela Bizera<br /></strong>
		<strong>Photo by B.V.<br /></strong><br />

	  
		Clement Mboye is a young man born in 2005 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. His family fled to Malawi due to security concerns. <br /><br />
		
    	“I don’t know how many countries we passed through to reach here because I was young then. We arrived in Malawi in the year 2011 and I started my primary education and now I am in my secondary level.” <br /><br />
		
		Currently, Clement is a student. He started writing poetry in Standard 5 after reading “The Broken Bridge,” which he enjoyed. It inspired him to learn about writing, and he wanted to start writing as well.  <br /><br />
		
		When he writes, it makes him feel confident, and it removes any fear. It builds his capacity, and he is able to think deeper. It brings him somewhere else.<br /><br />
		
		Watching different behaviors and how people lead countries made him write “Tears of Africa.”<br />
		“Our key to success has been buried, leaders are selfish and we have lost trust in them.”<br /><br />
		
		Clement would like to tell everyone reading the book and website that “we have talent. Join groups and promote talent.”

    	 TEARS OF AFRICA (Poem 1)<br /><br />
	  
    	Africans, the key to our success has been buried<br />
	  
      	We have no one to put our trust in because our leaders are selfish<br /><br />
	  
  	 	Laws are made to favour the rich and leave out the poor, suffering<br />
	  
		How can the land be rich and the people die with hunger<br /><br />
	  
	 	Anytime I time I think about Africa, the pain in my heart grows stronger <br />
	
		Why Africa? <br /><br /><br />

		THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW (Poem 2)<br /><br />
	
		The clock, it’s always ticking. It's time for you to choose  <br />

		Try to win the game of life, or accept that you will lose<br /><br />

		Some people are born to live, and some are born to die. Some people choose to walk<br />

		While others choose to fly <br /><br />
	
		No one can make you happy<br />
	
		No matter what you're going through, bad things happen to all of us. It’s not only you <br /><br />

		Stop feeling bad for yourself<br />

		Stop wallowing in your sorrow<br />

		If you can't pick yourself up today<br />
	
		Pick yourself up tomorrow<br />
