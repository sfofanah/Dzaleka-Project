	  	<strong>Gabriel Ndende</strong><br />
	  	<strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi</strong><br />
		<strong>Biography collected and written by Angela Bizera</strong><br />
		<strong>Photo by Primo Luanda Bauma<br /></strong><br />

	  
		Gabriel Ndende is a young man from two different nationalities, The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi. He came to Malawi in the year 2015 after his family fled due to security concerns. He is a student currently and has started his journey in a Bachelor of Arts in sustainable development, which is an online course. He is also interested in research. He is doing volunteer work as a librarian and does some community work as well.<br /><br />
		
    	He was motivated by listening to Prince Ea a lot, and that is when he discovered that he too can share something that can be educational to inspire others. He also likes to write stories. Late in 2019  is when he started doing more research, combined what he learned from school, and started to be creative and to write. For him, writing poems are ideas which are thoughts and need to be released to inspire and educate others.<br /><br />
		
		One of his poems “The Culture that Lies” is the one he loves the most because it talks about civic conflict in his country and the way they are living. They are divided into tribes, and they don’t like each other. The hatred started from ancestors who never explained why it started. But for them, they are just coping and following them without reasons or explanation. This is affecting their mindset with the conflicts, which don’t pay anything but hatred. He shared it so that young people should change and realize that the hate has no importance and that they should be role models instead.<br /><br />
		
		He is telling readers of the book and website that they should be motivated and inspired by his art and should take and use them to make change.

    	THE CULTURE THAT LIES<br />
	  
    	#Say no to Tribalism<br /><br />
	  
      	we see bombs now <br />
	  
  	 	those bombs break our homes<br />
	  
		now we are homeless<br />
	  
	 	hoping to find homes in heaven<br /><br />
	
		From nothing we are the victims<br />

		of unending tribalism<br />
	
		that draws away our happiness<br />

		and leaves fear as our weakness<br /><br />

		our grandfathers and grandmothers<br />

		could no longer chase animals but wind<br />
	
		which they did not catch until now<br /><br />
	
		the weak dogs that died longer ago<br />

		were busy whispering in their son's ears<br />

		"never like Tutsi, never like Hutu"<br />

		with the unknown reasons behind<br /><br />
	
		i see the frowning faces in churches,<br />
	
		in schools and everywhere<br />

		their faces look not younger but older<br />

		when still young to enjoy their youthful stage<br />

		but chasing nothing but achieving a false mindset<br /><br />
	
		ooooh weak dogs now you made us lose our homes and find other homes after deep struggles <br />
	
		due to the wrong seeds you planted<br />

		now we are harvesting names like <br />

		maburundi or makwerekwere <br />
