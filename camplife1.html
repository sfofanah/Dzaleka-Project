	Divine Irakoze is 22 years old. She is the Team Leader for Inspirational Stories for the Arts of
	Dzaleka Project. Divine’s parents and older siblings fled Burundi in the early 1990s. She was
	born in a refugee camp and has lived in camps her whole life. She left her family and the camp in
	the fall of 2022 to pursue a college degree in the USA where she is studying International
	Studies. She hopes someday to have a legal citizenship somewhere and to work as a refugee
	advocate.<br /><br />

	Ever been in a situation whereby you wonder where you belong? Feel like you don’t fit in
	anywhere? As in you don’t have a place to feel comfortable and welcomed. Well, I have felt this
	for the past 22 years that I have lived on this earth. I am a Burundian by nationality, a Tanzania
	by birth, and a Malawian by residence. My question has always been, where do I belong? Where
	do I come from? Which country do I present as my country? How do I describe this? I have
	always had so many unanswered questions in my head just like anybody else can after hearing
	this. I was born and raised in a refugee camp, and life has never been easy. I have always told
	people that being a refugee is not easy. You are fighting for space in a country that is not your
	own, living in an environment whereby you are limited to so many life-changing opportunities.<br /><br />

	The country of Malawi has very strict laws for refugees. Refugees and asylum-seekers are
	mainly hosted in the Dzaleka refugee camp, close to the capital city of Lilongwe. The
	government of Malawi has an encampment policy which restricts refugees from certain rights,
	such as access to tertiary education and formal employment. You need a permit to travel outside
	the camp. Accessing public schools and universities is a daily prayer. Acquiring the very basic
	knowledge is a hurdle for refugees in spite of the fact that access to education has been declared
	by the United Nations to be a human right. Work opportunities are not there. Life in the camp
	almost entirely depends on food distributions. The food at times is barely enough. Most girls are
	child mothers because they are lured by the old men to enable them to meet the basic needs for
	their families.<br /><br />

	In the case of refugees and in their defence, I want to argue that refugees are not just helpless
	because we can be equal partners in development. Just as Innocent Magambi, a refugee and
	refugee advocate points out, “the rumour that refugees are a security threat to any country is a
	common rhetoric used to divert attention away from internal causes.” Refugees are not security
	threats anywhere, but victims of security issues that exist where they come from and where they
	live. “Once we recognise that refugees have become part of the society, we will be ready to
	move forward with solutions that benefit everyone” (Refugees Should be Seen 2017). Starting
	from Malawi, this should also be voted to go to all countries hosting refugees so that refugees
	have the opportunity to be part of the society and work together toward development. <br /><br />

	Malawi should revise their policies for refugees. They should let refugees work and have
	opportunities like anybody else. We shouldn’t be seen as a threat or people who came to steal
	opportunities away. We should be seen as people who are people of the community now and
	have to work together towards development. The 2063 sustainable development goals will never
	be achieved by Malawians alone, but rather by giving opportunities to refugees to let them work
	together for the better development of the country.<br /><br />

	Refugees are also people like others who have vision, missions to accomplish, dreams, ambitions
	as well as goals to achieve in their lives. Let the world know that refugees are very amazing
	people. Like anybody else, we need love, respect, equal opportunities, and dignity. It was not our
	desire to leave our home countries or not to return. We lost everything and want to start a new
	chapter of our lives. This does not mean that we shouldn’t be considered as human beings. For
	someone to move away from the country, there is always a reason, and that reason is always a
	human rights violation. Despite being refugees, we still bear the name “human,'' and every
	human being is entitled to rights. We enjoy and exercise our rights which among our rights, we
	have the right to accomplish dreams, visions and ambitions.<br /><br />
