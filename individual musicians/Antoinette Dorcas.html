		  Democratic Republic of Congo<br />

25 years old<br />

Giresse Ino gathered musicians on 2, August, 2022 to be documented for this project<br />

Biography collected by Elizabeth Langran and written by Asa Sutton<br /><br />

Antoinette died suddenly and unexpectedly on March 21, 2023. Her family and friends believe she was poisoned. At the funeral, Giresse Ino composed and led a song in her memory, and other members of the community sang several songs together. We have included some of these images as a remembrance for Antoinette and as a reminder of how precarious life is for residents of Dzaleka.<br /><br />

Antoinette Bulambo Dorcas wants to use music to build a future for both herself and her family. Despite experiencing sexual violence at a young age, she is thankful to God for the life that she has had, and the place that music has within it– music that encourages her, gives her dignity and strength. She has been singing religious music in concerts since she was little, and both her daughter and her younger brother are singers as well, seeking similar peace. It is Antoinette’s hope that she can go to music school to further develop her talent, and that she can eventually begin putting out albums. No matter what happens in her life, she wants to sing.
