I am sharing two songs: “Mama” and “Work Hard.”<br /><br />

I’m a Congolese by nationality. I arrived in Malawi in 2016. Before starting music, I was a dancer, way back in the Congo. There was an American musician that I saw dancing and singing, and I got inspired. At first, I didn’t have resources. Due to insecurity in my country, I was not able to continue my new career in music. We were forced to flee to Malawi for safety. Upon my arrival in Dzaleka, life was difficult. Everything was dark, but I didn’t quit. I started writing songs inspired by the life I was facing and by my observations of what was going on around the world.<br /><br />
		  
In 2017 I released my first song. I was happy and proud that at last I had achieved a step towards my career. After I released another song, a lot of people started discouraging me, however, because in Dzaleka there is only low-quality sound available.  The two songs I had released were not high-quality compared to other songs that had been made by other professional musicians. <br /><br />
		  
After three months, one friend of mine connected me to an audio producer in Lumbadzi. I went there and recorded a song even though it cost me a lot. I started recording in other professional studios outside of Dzaleka, in Lilongwe, Kasungu, and Dowa Boma (town). I continued my solo career, and on my path I met the Biriwazi Mafia band. We produced three songs, as well as a music video for the song “Question Mark.” <br /><br />
		  
After two years, I separated from the band, and I started focusing on my solo career again. I started working with various Malawian musicians. In 2020, I released my first song with a Malawian artist named Teezy: “Ndakonzeka.” After doing the song, the audio producer Acoustic offered me a chance to release five songs–three bonuses and two songs that I only paid half price for. It was an opportunity for me, and I profited from it. I made five songs, including “Kumaganiza,” “Hability,” “Thanks Baba God,” and “Kamirigado.” <br /><br />
		  
Now I’m working on an album of eight songs that I will drop into the market next year in January. I do hiphop-dancehall: a mixed language that expresses joy and happiness to my supporters and to everyone who listens to my music. It gives a positive message of peace, harmony, and hope. My dream is to become an international artist and open a music and dancing school in my country or elsewhere, where people will have the opportunity to learn freely and promote their talent in music and dance. <br /><br />
		  
I invite all people who have the ability to help to come and support the development of arts in the Dzaleka refugee camp. A good way to support would be to help open a multimedia center whereby musicians and creative people will have access and opportunity to shoot good video clips.
