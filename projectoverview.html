	The website, which complements a forthcoming book by the same title, is a product of a
	collaborative effort by young artists living in the Dzaleka refugee camp, me (Lisa Gilman),
	Professor of Folklore and English at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia in the United
	States, and graduate and undergraduate students at George Mason University.<br /><br />
  	
	Each of the youth artists living in the camp took the leadership of documenting the arts and
	artists for one category. The Team Leader for Music is Congolese gospel singer Giresse Ino,
	Visual Arts and Crafts is Congolese painter Serge Kasongo, Dance is Congolese popular dancer
	Nellyson_Deo, Poetry is Rwandan poet Angela Azibera, Photography is Congolese photographer
	Luanda Bauma Primo, and Inspirational Stories is Burundian Divine Irakoze. While
	“Inspirational Stories” includes stories about non-artists as well as artists, the team agreed with
	Divine that these stories were important to include. Primo took many of the photographs that are
	included throughout the project.<br /><br />

	The Dzaleka team dedicated time in 2022 to identifying artists and art groups within the camp,
	collecting and writing short biographies for each, and documenting their arts. They uploaded
	these materials into a shared drive that the US team could access.<br /><br />

	The U.S.-based team then collaborated with the Dzaleka team to prepare the materials for the
	website and book. Undergraduate Sulaiman Fofanah came to the United States when he was very
	young as a refugee from Sierra Leone. He has worked on all aspects of the project. Originally,
	the project was just going to be a book. Sulaiman is majoring in website development and was
	excited to take the lead in creating the website. Undergraduates Audrie Bernard, a Community
	Health major and International Studies major Brendan West have been involved from the
	beginning and have contributed to all aspects of the project. Creative Writing master’s student
	Asa Sutton helped organize materials and copy-edit files in Fall 2022. Folklore master’s student
	Amanda Ellard worked on the final phase of the project helping to prepare materials with a focus
	on the book manuscript.<br /><br />

	I teach courses in folklore, ethnographic research methods, and African Studies. I have been
	doing research in Malawi on various topics related to arts and culture since 1995. In 2021, I
	launched a new global research project on arts initiatives by refugees for refugees. As a first step
	in this project, I attended for the first time the Tumaini Festival in November 2021. Tumaini is
	an elaborate multiday arts festival that takes place in the Dzaleka refugee camp annually. Takin
	advantage of the festival’s Homestay Program, I had the wonderful opportunity to stay with
	Divine’s family. Attending the develop, spending time with Divine’s family, and getting to know
	so many camp residents who are artists was transformative. I was impressed by the extensive 
	talent in the camp, while I was also deeply saddened and disturbed by the conditions for refugees
	in Malawi and by all the tragic stories that I heard. <br /><br />

	During this visit, I met numerous young artists who expressed frustration that despite the talent
	in the camp, artists who are refugees in Malawi have limited opportunities for displaying their
	arts, growing their audiences, or making money because of the restrictions placed on refugees by
	the Malawi government, their own tragic circumstances, and their limited access to resources.<br /><br />

	Inspired by these conversations, I discussed some ideas with Trésor Nzengu Mpauni, the founder
	of the Tumaini Festival and Tumaini Letu, the NGO through which the festival is organized. I
	was interested in offering my position and resources to augment the visibility of the arts in the
	camp and provide opportunities for young artist leaders. Together with Mpauni and Takeno Lab
	founder and director Burundian Remy Gakwaya, we brought together what became theTeam
	Leaders for the Dzaleka Arts Project. Gakwaya helped supervise the team during the bulk of the
	documentation, and I kept in close communication with them via WhatsApp. The US team
	communicated directly the Dzaleka team, offering each the opportunity to get to know one
	another across vast distances and build skills.<br /><br />

	There is so much talent and creativity in the Dzaleka camp. This project is limited, as there are
	many gaps in the documentation. The Team Leaders took advantage of their own networks, thus
	plenty of people outside their network were not included. Language barriers, cultural differences,
	artistic preferences, and limited time and space also contributed to gaps. The breadth of artists in
	the project is impressive, yet we also hope that this project will spark additional projects, just as
	the Tumaini Festival has fueled so much artistic activity in the camp along with our book and
	website projects.<br /><br />

	We invite visitors to this website to reach out to artists and others in the camp to engage with
	their arts and lives, support refugee arts and artists (in the camp and elsewhere) any way you can,
	and hopefully advocate for refugees and other displaced peoples in your own communities.
