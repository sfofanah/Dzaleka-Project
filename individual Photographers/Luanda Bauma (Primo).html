		  <p>
		  	Primo Luanda Bauma is from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Born in Goma in the North Kivu province, Primo came to Malawi with his family in 2016, fleeing insecurity and violence. Arriving in the Dzaleka refugee camp with his family, he was lost. He felt that his life had no meaning, as he had few prospects and life in the camp was difficult. Forced to flee to a country he’d never been to, with just his family, and no friends or connections to rely on, Primo felt stuck.  Soon after arriving in the camp, Primo fell into bad habits and did not know how to get out of the hole he found himself in. But he was able to find a new sense of purpose and meaning through his artwork and his photography. Taking a photography course with an organization in Dzaleka that offered it, Primo started to pursue photography not merely as art, but as life as well. <br /><br />
Primo started volunteering with organizations in the Dzaleka camp, and encouraged his family to pursue education, as he believes its value cannot be overstated. Seeking to set an example for his family, he pursued photography and now is one of the most recognized photographers in the camp. He has enjoyed success, such as having an exhibition in Malawi’s capital Lilongwe. Primo now is extended invitations to festivals, exhibitions, and more. <br /><br />
Primo places particular emphasis on education and opportunity, particularly for young people and young women in the camp. Oftentimes if a girl is not in school or is not working, she gets married at a young age or has children as a teenager. Primo has founded an organization to help support these young mothers by training them in life skills such as tailoring, courses in photography, sewing, and more. He says that young mothers like these often don’t have a lot of hope, thinking they don't have opportunities and cannot improve their lives. He helps to provide these women with what opportunities he can, because he’s been, if not in that same position, then the same frame of mind as these young women<br /><br />
Primo’s art has endowed him with numerous opportunities: creating a documentary about life in Dzaleka, participating in festivals in the camp, furthering his work as a photographer, and just generally becoming more known in the camp. Now, Primo’s artwork is furthering the Dzaleka Arts  Project, and helping show to the world the truth, of art, of hope, and of life in the camp.
