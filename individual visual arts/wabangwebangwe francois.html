  <strong>Biography</strong><br />
<p>
  <br />
  I was born in Kalmaie in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 03/03/2003. I grew up in Moba. I am from a family of six children. One of my brothers, the youngest, was taken hostage and for some time, there were only five of us. Four of my siblings chose to stay with my father, while I myself chose to stay with my mother, whom I love very dearly. Because of the hardships of life, my mother left my father, took with her the four children including me, and went away. Years later, after the separation and my mother’s death, I began living on the street because I had nothing without my mother, a lack of basic life necessities. <br /><br />
	
	Fortunately, I met a certain woman who called me and interviewed me. She asked me questions about my family, and I answered without hiding anything. She understood my situation and gave me the task of fetching water and selling cassava. Eventually, the quarreling and insecurities started in the DRC, including the killing of innocent people without any reason. Many people died, while others ran away looking for freedom in a more peaceful place. Our country was affected badly everywhere, and my sister and I did not have any choice but to run away to Malawi. 2015 was when I first experienced strange new things in a strange new country.<br /><br />
	
	After some time, I started to realize and understand the place, and started searching for a job, making bricks and fetching water for different houses. After two years, I suffered from a strange disease that came because of working too hard. Some months later, a doctor instructed me that I must not go back to that kind of work. Surely, the doctor said that if I continue working, it could develop into a severe problem. <br /><br />
	
	I started drawing art when I was 10 years old and on my own, without depending on anybody. When I was in Standard Four, I repeated class twice because I always liked to draw and I used to spend all my time on art rather than my classes. During that time, my mindset was a bit smaller. I liked using pencils when I started to draw different things like portraits, animals, houses, etc. Because it sent some different messages to different people, it was my favorite medium because it is easier to remember images drawn in black and white. That is why I always liked to draw with pencils as a way of sending messages to the people.<br /><br />
	
	I would like to open my mindset and imagination away from just using pencils, though. My dream is to be an international artist of painting. I dream of having a big gallery in the future at Art Club in the Dzaleka refugee camp.The only problem is lack of access to the right materials; some materials are usually found in countries abroad, which can be very difficult to get. <br /><br />
	
	In addition, after getting my certificate, I want to teach children and youth about art and how very important it is to others.<br /><br />
